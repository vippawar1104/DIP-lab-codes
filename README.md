# Digital Image Processing (DIP) Laboratory

## Overview
Digital Image Processing (DIP) involves analyzing, enhancing, and transforming images using computational techniques. This repository contains MATLAB implementations of fundamental DIP concepts and algorithms, including histogram equalization, grayscale conversion, and image filtering.

## Features
- **Image Import and Visualization**: Load and display digital images.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Transform color images into grayscale representations.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improve image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.
- **Color Channel Manipulation**: Generate red, green, or blue channel-only images.
- **Binary Thresholding**: Convert grayscale images to black and white using a threshold.
- **Image Enhancement**: Apply techniques to enhance visual quality.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or later is recommended)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dip-lab.git
